Understanding febonacci sequence & Merge Sort
Time/Space complexity and big-O notation

<!-- Notations -->

Big O notation
The Big O Notations in the order of speed from fastest to slowest are:

O(1) - Constant Complexity
O(log N) - Logarithmic Complexity
O(N) - Linear Complexity
O(N log N) - N x log N Complexity
O(n²) - Quadratic Complexity
O(n³) - Cubic Complexity
O(2ⁿ) - Exponential Complexity
O(N!) - Factorial Complexity
